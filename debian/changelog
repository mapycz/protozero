szn-libprotozero (1.5.3) Seznam; urgency=medium

  * Added

  More documentation.
  New size() method on iterator range used for packed repeated fields to find out how many elements there are in the range. This is much faster compared to the std::difference() call you had to do before, because the varints don't have to be fully decoded. See Advanced Topics for details.

  * Changed

  Updated clang-tidy settings in Makefiles and fixed a lot of minor issues reported by clang-tidy.
  Update included catch.hpp to version 1.10.0.
  Miscellaneous code cleanups.
  Support for invalid state in pbf_writer and packed_repeated_fields. This fixes move construction and move assignement in pbf_writer and disables the copy construction and copy assignement which don't have clear semantics. It introduces an invalid or empty state in the pbf_writer, pbf_builder, and packed_repeated_fields classes used for default-constructed, moved from, or committed objects. There is a new commit() function for pbf_writer and the packed_repeated_fields which basically does the same as the destructor but can be called explicitly.

  * Fixed

  The empty() method of the iterator range now returns a bool instead of a size_t.
